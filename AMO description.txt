<strong> Note that double-click on a tab (active or not) to pin/unpin is not going to be possible due to </strong> the limitations of the WebExtensions technology. Only Mozilla can fix it, not me. Look <a href='https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1246706'> here </a> and <a href='https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?format=default&id=1356949'> here </a> for more details. <strong> Instead, use the (arguably) more efficient alternative - a long left click anywhere on the webpage, which is also customizable in the add-on preferences.</strong>

Pin Unpin Tab is a Firefox WebExtension to pin or unpin a tab by
- a long left mouse click anywhere on the webpage (an arguably more efficient alternative to the no longer possible double-click on tab). This option can be enabled or disabled on the add-on's preferences page. The minimum duration to hold down the click also can be set. <strong> This approach will not work on <a href='https://addons.mozilla.org/'>AMO webpages</a> and the Firefox pages (eg., about:addons).</strong>
- a keyboard shortcut Alt-P
- a click on the pin icon on browser toolbar. The icon gels well with the default light and dark themes

<strong> Planned Enhancements </strong>
- A customizable keyboard shortcut
