Pin Unpin Tab is a Firefox WebExtension that toggles the pinned status of the active tab.

Currently, the add-on provides the following methods:

- Custom keyboard shortcut from addon preferences page. Defaults to `Alt+P`.
- A click on the pin icon on browser toolbar

## Planned Enhancements

This section lists the enhancements I have in mind. Though I am not sure if the WebExtension API possesses the required capabilities. We will see as we go.
