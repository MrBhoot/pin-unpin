Pin Unpin Tab is a Firefox WebExtension that toggles the pinned status of the active tab.

Currently, the add-on provides the following methods:

- Custom keyboard shortcut which defaults to 'Alt+P'.
- A click on the pin icon on browser toolbar

## Planned Enhancements

This section lists the enhancements I have in mind. Though I am not sure if the WebExtension API possesses the required capabilities. We will see as we go.

- Double-click on a tab (active or not) to toggle the pinned status
