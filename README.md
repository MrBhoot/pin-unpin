pin-unpin
=========

Firefox add-on to pin or unpin current tab through new, cooler ways.

It provides two non-mouse ways to pin or unpin current tab:

1. A customizable Keyboard Shortcut to pin/unpin a tab. Default is alt-p. You can change it to any <modifierkey-normalkey> combo that you like. Beware that any existing shortcut action will be overridden.

2. A geekier way is to use the Firefox Developer Command Line (also known as GCLI). The commands are:
pintab: Pin the current tab.
unpintab: Unpin the current tab.
