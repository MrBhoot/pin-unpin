Pin Unpin Tab is a Firefox WebExtension that toggles the pinned status of the active tab.

Currently, the add-on provides the following methods:

- Keyboard shortcut 'Alt-P'
- A click on the pin icon on browser toolbar

## Planned Enhancements

This section lists the enhancements I have in mind. Though I am not sure if the WebExtension API supports the required capability. We will see as we go.

- Customizable keyboard shortcut. An options page to make this happen
- Double-click on a tab (active or not) to toggle the pinned status
