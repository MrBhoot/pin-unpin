Pin Unpin Tab is a Firefox WebExtension using which you can pin or unpin a tab.

Currently, the add-on provides the following methods:

- A click on the pin icon on browser toolbar
- Keyboard shortcut 'Alt-P'
- Long left mouse click anywhere on the webpage
    - This option can be enabled or disabled on the add-on's preferences page.
    - The minimum duration to hold down the click can be set.
    - This approach will not work on [AMO webpages](https://addons.mozilla.org/) and the Firefox pages (eg., about:addons)


## Planned Enhancements

This section lists the enhancements I have in mind. Though I am not sure if the WebExtension API possesses the required capabilities. We will see as we go.

- Customizable keyboard shortcut.
- ~~Double-click on a tab (active or not) to toggle the pinned status~~
    - This is probably never going to be possible due to the limitations of the WebExtensions technology. Look [here](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1246706) and [here](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?format=default&id=1356949).
